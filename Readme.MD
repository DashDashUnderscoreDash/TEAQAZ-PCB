# **TEAQAZ**

TEAQAZ is an STM32 10u uniform stagger QAZ style PCB with leafsprings tadpole mounting with a forced [Mini ISO](https://sneakbox.com/products/weirdkeys?variant=48065165623538)

The 2u layout positions are forced stabless becuase stabs are dumb

It should have been called TAEQAZ, "Tiny Ass Enter", but I typo'd the file and silk so now it's TEAQAZ I guess
